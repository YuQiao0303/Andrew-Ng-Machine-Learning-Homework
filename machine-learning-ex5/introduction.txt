dataset: 1 dimentional X, 1 dimetional Y,

1. linearRegCostFunction.m: linear regression ( cost function) with regularization
2. earningCurve.m: learning curve (tells us it has high bias)
3. polyFeature.m: polynomial regression ( generate polynomial features by x)
4. ex5.m: modify lambda. learning curve and the visualized data tell us different lambda causes different results)
5. validationCurve.m: automatically choose lambda
6. (optional) calculate test error: i do it in ex5.m

note:
1.  know what parameter you are using, X? X_poly? are ones added?
2. know whether you're training or calculating error ( whether to use lambda)
